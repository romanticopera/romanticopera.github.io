<p>By the 1850s, tutti chords tended to conform to this model:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Example_07a_Tuttis_07_Freischutz_reduction.png" width="209"
height="160" /></p>
<p>This chord, which comes directly from the overture to Weber’s <em>Der
Freischutz</em> (p. 19), exhibits several properties
found in tutti chords written for standard Romantic orchestras:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flutes, clarinets, and oboes fill in all the chord-tones in the
upper register with a minimal amount of doubling</li>
<li>The horns fill in the chord-tones directly below the flutes,
clarinets, and oboes</li>
<li>The flutes play the highest notes of the chord</li>
<li>The bassoons play the lowest notes</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at the full score of Weber’s opera, we see that this chord
exhibits another common property of tutti chords, which is that each
section of the orchestra plays a complete chord:</p>

<p>Reduction:</p>
<p><img

width="307" height="432" /></p>
<p>Each section of the orchestra also plays the chord in its correct inversion (in root position,
with a C in the bass). This adds to the chord’s consonance, often a
desirable effect in a root-position major triad.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Fourths</strong></p>
<p>Because perfect fourths were still considered something of a
dissonance in Weber’s time, he avoids writing a perfect fourth in the
oboes. Instead of</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Example_07a_Tuttis_07b_Freischutz_hypothetical.png"
width="248" height="109" /></p>
<p>he writes a consonant interval for each woodwind pair:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Example_07a_Tuttis_07c_Freischutz_consonance.png"
width="313" height="151" /></p>
<p>He also avoids writing perfect fourths in the chord just prior to
this one, having the second flute double the third of the chord (E)
instead of the fifth (G), so as to avoid a perfect fourth in the
flutes:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Weber-Freischutz-Consonance-2.png" width="320"
height="128" /></p>
<p>(<em>Note: Fourths are usually only avoided in highly consonant
chords. Unstable chords, such as dominant sevenths and second-inversion
triads, can benefit from the inclusion of dissonant intervals.</em>)</p>
<p>In taller chords, perfect fourths in the flutes are often unavoidable
due to the ideal ranges of the instruments. For example, it is
best to leave the perfect fourth in the following chord intact, as the
high F is well outside the ideal range of the oboe and clarinet:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Woodwind-Ranges.png" width="198" height="176" /></p>
<p><strong>The Octave</strong></p>
<p>Frequently seen in the trumpets and bassoons, the octave, for
whatever reason, is often avoided in the higher woodwinds. When it does
appear, it is usually in the oboes.</p>
<p><strong>Weber’s Chord Throughout History</strong></p>
<p>In 1850, about thirty years after the premiere of Weber’s <em>Der Freischutz</em>,
Wagner wrote a nearly identical chord in <em>Lohengrin</em> (p. 14):</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Wagner-Lohengrin-Tutti-Chord-p14.png" width="680"
height="562" /></p>
<p>Reduction:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Wagner-Lohengrin-Tutti-Chord-p14-reducb.png" width="185"
height="166" /></p>
<p>In 1866, Smetana wrote a nearly identical chord in <em>The Bartered
Bride</em> (p. 623):</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Smetana-Bartered-Bride-Tutti-Chord-p623-score.png"
width="680" height="900" /></p>
<p>Reduction:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Smetana-Bartered-Bride-Tutti-Chord-p623-reduc.png"
width="182" height="143" /></p>
<p>And in 1890, Mascagni wrote a similar chord in <em>Cavalleria
Rusticana</em> (p. 269):</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Mascagni-Cavalleria-Tutti-Chord-p269-score.png" width="680"
height="1001" /></p>
<p>Reduction:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Mascagni-Cavalleria-Tutti-Chord-p269-reduc.png" width="185"
height="194" /></p>
<p>From these examples, we can see how this chord and its orchestration
were common across styles and nationalities, representing a standard
that composers returned to again and again throughout the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p><strong>Larger Orchestras &amp; Doubling</strong></p>
<p>Doublings tend to be concentrated in the middle register. The highest
register usually contains the fewest number of doublings, and often none
at all. Even in the largest orchestras, one can find cases where only a
single woodwind is providing the highest note of a chord, as in this
example from Wagner’s <em>Götterdammerung</em> (p. 324):</p>
