<p>Generally, the most prominent instruments in the orchestra should
double the voice. These include (a) the highest woodwind, (b) the
highest brass, and (c) the highest string.</p>
<p>The following orchestration,</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Voice-and-Orchestra-bad1.png" width="182"
height="105" /></p>
<p>would not make much sense, as the ear would not know where to focus
its attention. It would be better to write:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Voice-and-Orchestra-good1.png" width="170"
height="104" /></p>
<p>with all the most prominent instruments doubling the voice. The other
instruments can then fill in the remaining chord-tones:</p>

<p><strong>Melody</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this book, the words “voice” and “melody” are used
synonymously. Although the voice doesn’t always sing the melody in an
opera, in a tutti chord it almost always does.</p>
<p><strong>Doubling</strong></p>
<p>We have seen in a previous chapter how the most doubled chord-tone in
a root-position triad is the root. When the voice is singing a
chord-tone other than the root, however, that chord-tone is sometimes
doubled just as many, if not more, times than the root.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>Bizet, <em>Carmen</em> (p. 417):</p>

<p>Reduction:</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Bizet-Carmen-Tutti-Chords-reduced.png" width="518"
height="205" /></p>
<p>The most prominent voices in this passage are Frasquite and Mercédès
(Carmen, a mezzo-soprano, sings below them). They are doubled by the
flute and violin in the first chord, and by the flute, violin, and
trumpet in the second chord, in accordance with our principles.</p>
<p>(<em>Note the many parallel fifths in this passage, including those
between the soprano soloists and the choir and the bass and first
clarinet:</em>)</p>

<p>Schumann, <em>Genoveva</em> (p. 224):</p>

<p>First, it must be noted that Schumann has a reputation for being a
poor orchestrator, and this passage helps to show why. For one thing,
there is a missing chord-tone in the middle register, and while gaps are
common above the staff, gaps in the middle register are hardly ever
seen.</p>
<p>There is also an over-abundance of the pitch D in this chord, which
conflicts with the voice’s F. In fact, every brass instrument is playing
a D at its loudest dynamic, a triple <em>forte.</em> This creates a
difficult hurdle for the vocalist to overcome. And while Schumann
deserves our sympathy for having to deal with natural brass instruments,
which had more limitations than our modern counterparts, there is no
doubt that this passage could have been orchestrated better.</p>
<p>Verdi, <em>La Traviata</em> (p. 300):</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Verdi-La-Traviata-Tutti-Chord-p300.png" width="680"
height="979" /></p>
<p>Reduction (<em>Note: In Italian opera, Horns in A-flat transpose down
an octave plus a major third)</em>:</p>

<p>Wagner, <em>The Flying Dutchman</em> (p. 96):</p>
<p><img src="tuttichords/Example_08a_Voice_04_Wagner_Hollander_p96.png" width="680"
height="468" /></p>
<p>Reduction:</p>

<p>Many of our principles are in evidence here: the woodwinds fill in
all the chord-tones in the upper register, the horns fill in the
chord-tones below the woodwinds, the flutes play the highest notes, most
of the doublings occur in the middle register, each pair of woodwinds is
playing a consonant interval, and each section of the orchestra is
playing a complete chord.</p>
<p>If this orchestration has a fault, it is that the trumpets do not
double the voice. But this is less of a concern here than it was in the
Schumann because Wagner’s brass section is more evenly distributed among
the chord tones. Whereas before, the brass instruments
<em>conflicted</em> with the voice, strongly asserting one pitch while
the voice asserted another, here the two sections — brass and voice —
merely complement each other, neither conflicting nor agreeing
unanimously.</p>
